# Math Test processing - computer vision
### Computer Vision course project repo

Developed a robust and efficient system to handle the extraction and pre-processing of images containing handwritten math exam answer sheets from students in 4th and 5th grades. This involved working with a substantial dataset, consisting of 3,300 labeled images and 14,000 unlabeled images.
In order to enhance the understanding of the data, a sophisticated coordinate mapping approach was employed across nine specific sections. This technique allowed for the generation of distinct features and effective segmentation of the data, contributing to a more granular analysis.
Advanced image recognition techniques were implemented to ensure accurate labeling of the data, facilitating the identification and categorization of relevant information within the images.
The entire process was designed for streamlined efficiency, encompassing both labeled and unlabeled image data. Information from over 50 image areas was systematically consolidated, promoting efficient and thorough analysis of the data. This meticulous approach aimed to provide a comprehensive and detailed understanding of the content within the handwritten math exam answer sheets, thereby contributing to the overall success of the image processing pipeline.
